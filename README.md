# OS

In this project I made OS recommendations to a faux company who was transitioning there game to a new platform to gain new users.  I recommended that the game me adapted to IOS due to the popularity of the platform and security features available.  I learned how to think about items such as memory, iCloud, storage, and security while completing this project.  I would choose to do more work on the actual coding aspect of the project because I could use more practice on that.  I took into account that the game already functioned on Androids and thought it would be a logical step to move to IOS.  My approach was to do what makes sense.
